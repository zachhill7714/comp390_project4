Create a new virtual environment in the root directory using the command "python -m venv .venv" in Command Prompt.
To install dependencies for this project, open up the project directory. Activate your virtual environment (if it's not already activated; it should say (.venv) on the command line if it already is) by going to "./.venv/Scripts" and typing in "activate.bat". Then back out to the root directory and type "pip install -r requirements.txt". This will add all of the required dependencies for this project.

To run the script type "python app.py" while the virtual environment is activated.
